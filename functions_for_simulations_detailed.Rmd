# Overview

There are many reasons we might want to simulate data in R, and I find being able to simulate data to be incredible useful in my day-to-day work.  Today I'm going to talk some of the functions R has available that are useful to get to know when simulating data.  While some of them may already be familiar to you, I thought we'd take a closer look at how to use them.

So here's what we'll look at today

1. Explore random number generation with `rnorm()`, `runif()` and `rpois()` (rbinom?)
2. Use `rep()` to generate grouped variables
3. Dive into `replicate()` for repeating data simulation many times
4. (Possibly) Talk about looping through the simulations and pulling out results via `purrr::map()` loops and/or `for()` loops.

# Generating random numbers

We can generate random numbers from different distributions via the functions for pulling random deviates.  These functions always start with `r`.

The basic distributions that I use the most for generating random numbers are the normal (`rnorm()`), uniform (`runif()`), and Poisson (`rpois()`) distributions.  There are many others available as part of the **stats** package (e.g., binomial, log normal, beta, exponential, Gamma) and, as you can imagine, even more available in add-on packages.  

## `rnorm()` for random numbers from the normal distribution

## `runif()` pulls from the uniform distribution

## Discrete counts with `rpois()`
