# Getting started simulating data in R: some helpful functions and how to use them

This is a presentation for the [Eugene R Users Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-cwPiAlnB/) on August 28, 2018.

## Overview

Knowing how to simulate data in R has been incredibly useful to me in my day-to-day work.  Simulating data is useful not only for exploring the long-run behavior of a statistic but also allows you to make small datasets for working out hard data manipulation tasks or for testing your intuition about a mathematical relationship or statistical model.  But how does a person get started with simulations?  

In this talk I will go over some of the functions R has available to help with simulating data.  I'll discuss functions for random number generation, replicating elements of a vector, and repeated data generation.  We'll go in depth on how to use these functions and then practice creating datasets of different shapes and sizes. 

## Materials

I will do interactive work in the meetup using  [functions_for_simulations_simple.Rmd](https://github.com/aosmith16/simulation-helper-functions/blob/master/functions_for_simulations_simple.Rmd).  To download a copy so you can run the code, save the ["Raw" file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aosmith16/simulation-helper-functions/master/functions_for_simulations_simple.Rmd).  (Make sure the file you save ends in `.Rmd`, not `.txt`.)

For a detailed explanation of the code along with the code and output, see the [pdf document](https://github.com/aosmith16/simulation-helper-functions/blob/master/functions_for_simulations_detailed.pdf).  I've included a couple of extra examples here that I didn't have time to hit on in the Meetup.
