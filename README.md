# Getting started simulating data in R: some helpful functions and how to use them

This is a presentation for the [Eugene R Users Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-cwPiAlnB/) on August 28, 2018.

## Overview

Knowing how to simulate data in R has been incredibly useful to me in my day-to-day work.  Simulating data is useful not only for exploring the long-run behavior of a statistic but also allows you to make small datasets for working out hard data manipulation tasks or for testing your intuition about a mathematical relationship or statistical model.  But how does a person get started with simulations?  In this talk I will go over some of the functions R has available to help with simulating data.  I'll discuss functions for random number generation, replicating elements of a vector, and repeated data generation.  We'll go in depth on how to use these functions and then practice creating datasets of different shapes and sizes.
